Led blinking -> No connect (maybe just pair is ok)
Using these below AT command to check.

9．AT command set 
The way to the AT command mode: supply power to the module, it will enter to the AT mode if it 
needn’t pair. The interval of command is about 1 second. 
Default parameter: Baud rate:9600N81, ID: linvor, Password:1234 

1. Test communication 
Send: AT (please send it every second) 
Back: OK 

2. Reset the Bluetooth serial baud rate 
Send: AT+BAUD1 
Back: OK1200 
Send: AT+BAUD2 
Back: OK2400 
…… 
1---------1200 
2---------2400 
3---------4800 
4---------9600 (Default) 
5---------19200 
6---------38400 
7---------57600 
8---------115200 
9---------230400 
A---------460800 
B---------921600 
C---------1382400 
PC can’t support the baud rate lager than 115200. The solution is: make the MCU have higher baud 
rate (lager than 115200) through programming, and reset the baud rate to low level through the AT 
command. 
The baud rate reset by the AT command can be kept for the next time even though the power is cut 
off. 

3. Reset the Bluetooth name 
Send: AT+NAMEname 
Back: OKname 
Parameter name: Name needed to be set (20 characters limited) 
Example: 
Send: AT+NAMEbill_gates 
Back: OKname 
 Now, the Bluetooth name is reset to be “bill_gates” 
The parameter can be kept even though the power is cut off. User can see the new Bluetooth name 
in PDA refresh service. (Note: The name is limited in 20 characters.) 

4. change the Bluetooth pair password 
Send: AT+PINxxxx 
Back:OKsetpin 
Parameter xxxx: The pair password needed to be set, is a 4-bits number. This command can be used 
in the master and slave module. At some occasions, the master module may be asked to enter the 
password when the master module tries to connect the slave module (adapter or cell-phone). Only if the 
password is entered, the successful connection can be built. At the other occasions, the pair can be finish 
automatically if the master module can search the proper slave module and the password is correct. 
Besides the paired slave module, the master can connect the other devices who have slave module, such 
as Bluetooth digital camera, Bluetooth GPS, Bluetooth serial printer etc. 
Example: 
Send: AT+PIN8888 
Back: OKsetpin 
Then the password is changed to be 8888, while the default is 1234. 
This parameter can be kept even though the power is cut off. 

5. No parity check ( The version, higher than V1.5, can use this command ) 
Send: AT+PN (This is the default value) 
Back: OK NONE 

6. Set odd parity check ( The version, higher than V1.5, can use this command ) 
Send: AT+PO 
Back: OK ODD 
 
7. Set even parity check( The version, higher than V1.5, can use this command ) 
Send: AT+PE 
Back: OK EVEN 

8. Get the AT version 
Send: AT+VERSION 
Back: LinvorV1.n
